  You may be wondering why your developer applicant has just linked you to a site titled "Senior Mechanical Engineer", welcome to my journey into software development.
  If you would like to read more about my story see the "A Little More About Me" section.
  
  I bring with me years of lessons learned as a senior engineer in ambulance manufacturing, as well as the technical skills I have developed in software engineering along the way. 
  Please feel free to review my projects, and contact me if you feel I would be a good fit for your company.




#  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#what-is-markdown) supports such as

          A common issue many companies fall into is haphazard file structure accumulated over that years,
          the REST desktop application was the solution to this issue.

          ![alt text](images/rest-demo.png "REST")
          
          REST provides a central tool to quickly locate engineering
          related files.
          This project began as a series of locator scripts written in python as command-line tool-suite. After picking up Java, that initial idea was rolled into this desktop application.
          It has been fully refactored thrice over the past few years.
          This software currently saves about 30 min per Engineer/ per day.

  - title: A Little More About Me
    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      I graduated from UCF with a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering in the fall of 2017. I had spent my most of my undergraduate spare time working with the
      UCF Society of Automotive Engineering designing off-road race cars, working primarily as a machinist. This experience quickly launched me into the automotive world of ambulance manufacturing.

      Just around my third year working as a REV engineer, I started to realize I could greatly improve my quality and efficiency by scripting portions of my workload. It started off small,
      with some messy Python scripts, and within a year I had graduated to comprehensive desktop applications written in Java. I found my true passion in software development, in which I have relentlessly
      been expanding my skills these past three years. 

      More recently have been promoted to senior engineer. I have found many of the lessons I have learned along this journey strongly support my candidacy for software development.  
      I have over 300 unique designs, totaling more than 600 ambulances that I have been responsible for. Working in a production
      environment has allowed me develop many skills such as time management, stress management, ability to effectively communicate with both technical 
      and non-technical colleagues, the ability to teach as well as learn, and the ability to take
      on the responsibility for reviewing and releasing packages to production.
